# ðŸš€ DEPLOY THIS NOW - PayAI Facilitator Fix

## The Problem (Found!)

The facilitator was returning `400 Bad Request` because we weren't sending the correct payload structure.

## The Solution âœ…

According to PayAI's official docs at https://docs.payai.network/x402/reference, the facilitator expects:

**Verify/Settle Request:**
```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "base",
  "payload": {
    "authorization": "...",
    "signature": "0x..."
  },
  "paymentRequirements": {
    "maxAmountRequired": "100000",
    "asset": "0x...",
    "payTo": "0x...",
    "resource": "https://sundial.exchange/api/stats",
    "description": "...",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 300
  }
}
```

## What We Changed

1. **Parse the X-PAYMENT header** - It's base64-encoded JSON containing the payment proof
2. **Extract the payment proof** - Contains `scheme`, `network`, and `payload` (authorization + signature)
3. **Send to facilitator** - Combine payment proof with our payment requirements

## Files Changed

- âœ… `middleware.ts` - Now parses payment header and sends correct structure
- âœ… Added `parsePaymentHeader()` helper function
- âœ… Updated `verifyPayment()` to use PayAI format
- âœ… Updated `settlePayment()` to use PayAI format

## Deploy Commands

```bash
cd /Users/dylanboudro/Desktop/sundial.exchange

# Review changes
git diff middleware.ts

# Commit
git add middleware.ts docs/
git commit -m "Fix x402: use correct PayAI facilitator API format

- Parse X-PAYMENT header to extract payment proof
- Send payment proof with payment requirements to facilitator
- Matches PayAI facilitator API spec from docs.payai.network
- Fixes 400 Bad Request errors

Based on: https://docs.payai.network/x402/reference section 7.1"

# Deploy
git push
```

## Expected Vercel Logs (Success!)

After you pay on x402scan, you should see:

```
[x402] Incoming GET /api/dex/overview { hasPayment: true }
[x402] Payment header received: eyJ...
[x402] Verifying payment for resource: https://sundial.exchange/api/dex/overview
[x402] Payment proof network: base
[x402] Trying verification with base network...
[x402] Verify payload: {"x402Version":1,"scheme":"exact","network":"base","payload":{"authorization":"...","signature":"0x..."},"paymentRequirements":{...}}
[x402] base verification response (200): {"isValid":true}
[x402] Payment verified successfully on base!
[x402] Settlement result: { success: true, txHash: '0x...' }
```

Then the API returns actual data! ðŸŽ‰

## Why This Works

The `X-PAYMENT` header from x402scan contains:
```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "base",
  "payload": {
    "authorization": "...", // EIP-3009 authorization
    "signature": "0x..."    // Wallet signature
  }
}
```

We were trying to send the entire base64 string, but the facilitator needs:
1. The **payment proof** (from the X-PAYMENT header)
2. PLUS our **payment requirements** (amount, asset, recipient, etc.)

Now we're sending both! âœ…

## Test on x402scan

1. Wait 2 minutes for Vercel deployment
2. Go to x402scan.com
3. Click "Request" on your resource
4. Complete the payment
5. **GET ACTUAL DATA!** ðŸŽŠ

**DEPLOY THIS NOW!** This should finally work! ðŸ’ª
