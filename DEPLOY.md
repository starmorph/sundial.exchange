# Deploy x402scan Fix

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

Your x402scan integration was failing because of a **resource URL mismatch**:
- x402scan pays for: `https://sundial.exchange/api/stats` (no www)
- Middleware was checking: `https://www.sundial.exchange/api/stats` (with www)

Now all URLs are normalized to the canonical domain: `https://sundial.exchange`

## 🚀 **Deploy Now**

```bash
cd /Users/dylanboudro/Desktop/sundial.exchange

# Stage changes
git add middleware.ts __tests__/middleware.test.ts openapi.yaml docs/

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix x402scan: normalize resource URLs to canonical domain"

# Deploy to Vercel
git push
```

## ⏱️ **Wait for Deployment**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dylanboudro/sundial-exchange
2. Wait for "Building..." → "Ready" (~2 minutes)
3. ✅ Deployment complete!

## ✅ **Test on x402scan**

1. Go to: https://www.x402scan.com
2. Find your registered resources
3. Click "Request" on any endpoint
4. Complete the Base payment ($0.10 USDC)
5. **You should get actual data back!** 🎉

## 📊 **Check Logs**

After testing, check Vercel logs:

Expected output:
```
[x402] Incoming GET /api/stats { hasPayment: true }
[x402] Payment header received: eyJ...
[x402] Verifying payment for resource: https://sundial.exchange/api/stats
[x402] Original request URL: https://www.sundial.exchange/api/stats
[x402] base verification response (200): {"isValid":true}
[x402] Payment verified successfully on base!
[x402] Settlement result: { success: true, txHash: '0x...' }
```

## 🎊 **Success!**

If you see actual API data (not another 402 response), **it worked!**

Example successful response:
```json
{
  "tps": 2847.5,
  "solPriceUsd": 142.53,
  "tvlUsd": 4250000000,
  "volume24hUsd": 890000000,
  "solChange24hPct": 3.2,
  "tvlChange24hPct": -0.5,
  "volume24hChangePct": 15.7
}
```
