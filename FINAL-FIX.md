# üéØ THE ACTUAL FIX - Network Mismatch

## The Real Problem

**We were trying BOTH networks with the SAME payment proof!**

Your logs showed:
```
[x402] Payment proof network: base
[x402] Trying verification with base network...
[x402] Verify payload: {"network":"base",...}
[x402] base verification response (400): {"error":"Invalid request"}
[x402] Trying verification with solana network...
[x402] Verify payload: {"network":"base",...}  ‚Üê STILL "base"!
[x402] solana verification response (400): {"error":"Invalid request"}
```

**The bug:** We looped through both networks but always sent `paymentProof.network` (which was "base") in the payload!

When x402scan pays on Base, the payment proof says `"network": "base"`. We should ONLY verify with Base, not try Solana too!

## The Fix ‚úÖ

**Before (Wrong):**
```typescript
// Loop through BOTH networks
for (const { network, payTo, asset } of networks) {
    const verifyPayload = {
        network: paymentProof.network,  // Always "base"!
        // ...
    }
    // Tries both base and solana with base payment
}
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
// Use ONLY the network from the payment proof
const paymentNetwork = paymentProof.network  // "base"
const payTo = paymentNetwork === "solana" ? SOLANA_ADDRESS : BASE_ADDRESS
const asset = paymentNetwork === "solana" ? USDC_SOLANA : USDC_BASE

const verifyPayload = {
    network: paymentProof.network,  // Matches payment!
    // ...
}
// Single verification with correct network
```

## What Changed

- ‚úÖ Removed the network loop
- ‚úÖ Extract network directly from `paymentProof.network`
- ‚úÖ Set correct `payTo` and `asset` based on payment network
- ‚úÖ Single verification attempt (not both networks)

## Deploy

```bash
git add middleware.ts
git commit -m "Fix x402: use payment proof network directly

- Payment proof already specifies the network
- Don't try both networks, use the one from payment
- Fixes network mismatch causing 400 errors"
git push
```

## Expected Logs (Success!)

```
[x402] Payment proof network: base
[x402] Verifying payment on base network...
[x402] Verify payload: {"x402Version":1,"scheme":"exact","network":"base"...}
[x402] Verification response (200): {"isValid":true}
[x402] Payment verified successfully on base!
[x402] Settlement result: { success: true, txHash: '0x...' }
```

**THEN THE API RETURNS DATA!** üéâ

**This is the actual fix. Deploy now!** üí™
