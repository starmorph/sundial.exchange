# x402scan Troubleshooting - Next Steps

## What We Just Did

Added comprehensive debug logging to middleware to diagnose why x402scan payment isn't working.

### New Logging Output

Every API request will now show:

```
[x402] Incoming GET /api/stats {
  origin: 'https://www.x402scan.com',
  referer: 'https://www.x402scan.com/resources/123',
  userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 Chrome/...',
  hasPayment: true
}
```

Plus detailed verification and settlement logs!

## The Problem (Recap)

When you use x402scan to pay for API access:

1. ‚úÖ x402scan shows the payment request
2. ‚úÖ You complete the transaction on Base
3. ‚úÖ Your USDC balance decreases (payment sent)
4. ‚ùå **You get another 402 response instead of data**

This means the payment header is either:
- Not being sent by x402scan
- Being sent but verification is failing

## What To Do Now

### Step 1: Deploy the Updated Code

```bash
cd /Users/dylanboudro/Desktop/sundial.exchange

# Check what changed
git diff middleware.ts

# Commit and push
git add middleware.ts docs/
git commit -m "Add comprehensive x402 debug logging for x402scan troubleshooting"
git push
```

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Check deployment status
open https://vercel.com/dylanboudro/sundial-exchange
```

Wait for the deployment to complete (~1-2 minutes).

### Step 3: Test on x402scan Again

1. Go to x402scan.com
2. Find your registered resource: `https://sundial.exchange/api/stats`
3. Click "Request" or "Test"
4. Complete the payment transaction
5. **Note the exact error/response you get**

### Step 4: Check Vercel Logs IMMEDIATELY

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dylanboudro/sundial-exchange
2. Click "Logs" (or "Functions" ‚Üí "Logs")
3. Look for entries with `[x402]` prefix
4. **Copy ALL the log output** (especially around the time you tested)

### Step 5: Share the Logs

The logs will show one of these scenarios:

#### Scenario A: No Payment Header
```
[x402] Incoming GET /api/stats { origin: '...', hasPayment: false }
[x402] No payment header found, returning 402
```

**Meaning:** x402scan isn't sending the `X-PAYMENT` header after you pay.

**Likely Cause:** 
- x402scan bug
- CORS blocking the header
- Need to configure custom headers in x402scan registration

**Fix:** Add header to x402scan registration:
```
Header Name:  X-402-Test
Header Value: enabled
```

#### Scenario B: Payment Header Sent But Verification Failed
```
[x402] Incoming GET /api/stats { origin: '...', hasPayment: true }
[x402] Payment header received: eyJhbGciO...
[x402] Verifying payment for resource: https://www.sundial.exchange/api/stats
[x402] Trying verification with base network...
[x402] base verification response (200): {"isValid":false,"invalidReason":"resource mismatch"}
[x402] Payment verification failed: resource mismatch
```

**Meaning:** Payment was sent but the resource URL doesn't match.

**Likely Cause:**
- You submitted `https://sundial.exchange` (no www)
- But our middleware sees `https://www.sundial.exchange` (with www)
- Or vice versa

**Fix:** Normalize the resource URL in middleware (we'll do this once we confirm).

#### Scenario C: Verification Succeeds But Settlement Fails
```
[x402] Payment verified successfully on base!
[x402] Verification result: { isValid: true, network: 'base' }
[x402] Settlement result: { success: false, error: 'insufficient balance' }
```

**Meaning:** Payment was valid but settlement failed.

**Likely Cause:**
- Facilitator issue
- Timeout
- Network congestion

**Fix:** Adjust timeout or retry logic.

#### Scenario D: Everything Works!
```
[x402] Payment verified successfully on base!
[x402] Verification result: { isValid: true, network: 'base' }
[x402] Settlement result: { success: true, txHash: '0xabc123...' }
```

**Meaning:** It works! You should get API data back.

## x402scan Registration Settings

**For now, leave the custom headers EMPTY when registering.**

Only add custom headers if logs show they're needed.

### Current Registration:

```
Resource URL: https://sundial.exchange/api/stats
Custom Headers: (none)
```

### If Logs Show We Need Headers:

We might need to add:

```
Header Name:  Origin
Header Value: https://www.x402scan.com
```

Or:

```
Header Name:  X-Requested-With
Header Value: x402scan-client
```

**But wait for the logs first!**

## Quick Test Before x402scan

To verify the API is working with proper payment:

```bash
# 1. Get the 402 challenge
curl -i https://sundial.exchange/api/stats

# You should see:
# HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
# Content-Type: application/json
# 
# {"x402Version":1,"error":"X-PAYMENT header is required","accepts":[...]}

# 2. Check if there are redirects
curl -I https://sundial.exchange/api/stats 2>&1 | grep -i location
curl -I https://www.sundial.exchange/api/stats 2>&1 | grep -i location

# If you see "Location:" headers, that's a redirect problem!
```

## What We're Looking For in Logs

The logs will tell us:

1. **Is x402scan sending the payment header?**
   - Look for: `hasPayment: true` or `hasPayment: false`

2. **What's the exact resource URL?**
   - Look for: `Verifying payment for resource: https://...`

3. **Why is verification failing?**
   - Look for: `invalidReason: "..."`

4. **Is there a network mismatch?**
   - x402scan might be sending payment for wrong network

5. **Is the origin/referer from x402scan?**
   - Look for: `origin: 'https://www.x402scan.com'`

## After We See the Logs

Based on what the logs show, we'll:

1. **Fix the middleware** if it's our code issue
2. **Update x402scan registration** if we need custom headers
3. **Normalize URLs** if there's a www/non-www mismatch
4. **Contact x402scan support** if it's their bug

## Expected Timeline
