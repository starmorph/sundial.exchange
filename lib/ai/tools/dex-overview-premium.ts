/**
 * Premium DEX Overview Tool (x402 Payment Required)
 * 
 * This tool demonstrates how to integrate x402 micropayments with AI tool calls.
 * When the AI calls this tool, it will trigger a payment flow in the UI.
 * 
 * Payment Flow:
 * 1. AI determines it needs to call this tool
 * 2. Frontend intercepts the tool call (via onToolCall callback)
 * 3. Payment modal is shown to user
 * 4. User approves payment via x402
 * 5. Tool execution proceeds with verified payment
 * 
 * NOTE: This is a placeholder implementation. The actual payment verification
 * would need to happen server-side via middleware or within the tool execute function.
